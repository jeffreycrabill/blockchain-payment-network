# blockchain-payment-network

The purpose of this project is to build a code that enables customers to send cryptocurrency payments to fintech professionals. <br>
The steps to complete the payment network were: <br>
-Generate a new Ethereum account instance by using the mnemonic seed phrase provided by Ganache <br>
-Fetch and display the account balance associated with the Ethereum account address. <br>
-Digitally sign a transaction that pays a Fintech Finder candidate, and send this transaction to the Ganache blockchain. <br>
-Review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction. <br>

## Usage

To use this program, download github repository clone in a local environment.  Then you must download Ganache and open a new ethereum workspace.  Copy the mnemonic code and save it to a .env file in the github clone you created. Open the "fintech_finder.py" file, run the file and type "streamlit run fintech_finder.py" into the command line.  This will open up the host on your browser.  From there you can you can view potential fintech professional contractors, their hourly rate, and ethereum addresses.  You can choose how many hours you will need to pay them for, see if the total wage is affordable to you, and initiate the payment.  Here it is in action: <br>
-First, choose a professional to work with ![](/Images/1.png)  <br>
-Next, input how long they will be hired for.  This will be multiplied by their hourly rate to show you their wage. ![](/Images/2.png)  <br>  
-Finally, send the ether and keep the transaction hash for your records. ![](/Images/3.png) <br>  
You can see it records the sender, receiver, and amount for each block in the ledger.  It also shows the difficult of each block, and can validate the chain. <br>

## Technologies
This project was created with on with python v3.7.13.  It also uses streamlit for the user interface.  The seed code was generated by Ganche

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is an open source data analysis and manipulation tool.

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) turns data scripts into shareable web apps.

[Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) creates a personal Ethereum blockchain which can run tests, execute commands, and inspect state while controlling how the chain operates.
